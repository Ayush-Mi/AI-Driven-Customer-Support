## Introduction

The **AI-Driven Customer Support** project is designed to leverage AI Agents to streamline and automate customer support. For the demo purpose I have used Coursera platform and their support articles available on their website. This tool takes in
an email query sent by the customer and tries to answer based on the support articles already available.

This is just for the demonstration purpose and can be further integrated with any internal data system of a company which has previous responses of queries answered by human.

This can easily be integrated with an existing system to trigger when an email is recieved.

Fintuning a language model on the existing customer service data would be more useful for practical purposes.


## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understand and generate human-like text responses.
- **Chatbot Integration:** Can be seamlessly integrate with chat platforms.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Access and retrieve information from knowledge bases for quick resolutions.

## Project Structure

The whole project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Data collection
   
The data used here has been collected by scrapping [Coursera's Learner Help Center](https://www.coursera.support/s/learner-help-center?language=en_US). A set of links with support article that has answers to commonly asked questions is collected using
`web_scrape.ipynb` notebook and stored in `suport_links.txt`

2. Response generation using AI agents

The AI Agent based customer support system consists of two agents, 'Customer Support Agent' with the task to resolve any query raised by customer in an email and 'Support Quality Assurance Agent' with the task to
review the response generated by the support agent and make sure all the quality checks are done properly. The backend uses Llama-3 via Ollama to do perform various language operations. When an email is recieved, its subject line is matched with
all the available support article URL currently in the database and the top 3 matching article's URL is sent to agent for reference purpose. This can be found in `get_links.py` file. The AI agents get to work based on these information to generate a response, the code
for which can be found in `ai_agent.py`

3. Email/chatbot integration

This is for the future integration as this requires google auth (if using gmail) or any other email api to monitor for incoming email and auto reply based on the response generated by the AI agents.


To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Mi/AI-Driven-Customer-Support.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd AI-Driven-Customer-Support
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Install the required packages with:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and include necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for guidance.

5. **Run the Application:**

   Start the application using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Architecture

## Models and Tools

The repository includes:

- **NLP Models:** For text understanding and generation.
- **Sentiment Analysis Tools:** To assess and respond to customer sentiment.
- **Integration Scripts:** For connecting with external chat platforms.

Check the `models/` and `scripts/` directories for more details on these components.
